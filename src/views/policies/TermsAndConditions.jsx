            <h3>Definition</h3>
            <p>
              “Jewellery” means the jewellery that is predesigned or jewellery
              set with silver, gold and lab-grown diamonds that are available
              for sale on our website/retail stores. Please note that all
              Jewellery is sold on an “as is” basis. “Mounts” are defined as
              designs that hold a diamond(s) in place, which may or may not have
              diamonds. Members can select Mounts and diamonds separately to
              create customized Jewellery. “Loose Diamonds” are individual
              diamonds that can be bought without being set on Mounts.

            <p>
              External links may be provided for your convenience, but they are

            <h3>Prices</h3>
            <p>
              Our pricing is calculated using current precious metal and gem
              prices to give you the best possible value. These prices do change
              from time to time, owing to the fluctuations in prices of precious
              metal and diamond prices, so our prices change as well. The
              pricing of the metal on the day of purchase/advance payment will
              be considered in pricing for customers.
            </p>
            <p>
              Prices on www.bijouco.in are subject to change without notice.
              Please expect to be charged the price for the www.bijouco.in
              merchandise you buy as it is listed on the day of purchase.
            </p>
            <p>
              Pricing may change slightly due to variance between metal and
              diamond estimate provided on the website and the actual finished
              product. Such increase/decrease would be collected/refunded to the
              customer at the time of final sale.
            </p>
